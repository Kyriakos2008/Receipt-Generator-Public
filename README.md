# 📄 Receipt Generator (Public Version)

A simple, fast, and user-friendly **receipt generation tool** built in Python using **Tkinter** and **ReportLab**.

This project was originally developed for my father’s company to make it easier for him to create consistent, professional receipts for clients.  
This public version contains **placeholder company information** and **sample data only**.
